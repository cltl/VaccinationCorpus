        <spannedText>They shift the blame to others, and deny problems with the vaccine until there is too much evidence to ignore. Then, without skipping a beat, a new vaccine or a new recommendation will hit the market… people will shift to the new “improved” vaccine, or the updated recommendation for more boosters, and business will continue as usual. There will always be people who have problems with vaccines, and they will always be ignored or ridiculed. Nothing changes! That being said, I am glad most of those with measles turned out to be “unvaxxed”! This is a natural risk non-vaxxers take: we do not vaccinate and (all things being equal) stand a higher chance of getting measles. I take my chances with measles, and it has little effect on a vaccinated person, as the vaccine actually works. High efficacy rates are good for everyone - and takes a lot of the wind out of any herd immunity arguements. You truly can vaccinate and feel relatively certain you will not get mealses. I wish all vaccines were as effective as the measles portion of MMR. When it comes to measles, the argument is that the vaccine is effective, therefore everyone needs to be vaxxed to protect the vulnerable. But if the measles vaccine is really that effective, a small group of people turning it down are not going to be able to create a large enough outbreak to cause serious problems, therefore harassing that small group is just being mean, rather than putting public health efforts into areas where they are really needed, like antibiotic failure. Originally I was planning to delay vaccinations for my oldest DS (3 years) but as he got older I felt more comfortable with not getting him any shots until he was substantially older. Now I have a newborn in the house and I have all sorts of fears about my decision. I think my fears are also being fueled by the numerous articles regarding the measles cases in California and the hateful comments people make towards “anti-vax” parents. Thing is, I would not classify myself as anti-vax. I constantly research and reevaluate my position but I have never had that “ahh I’m now ready to give my oldest his shots” moment. I’m planning on having most of my oldest done before kindergarten but originally I intended on starting them when he was 2. DH and I were rolling our eyes at a local news story about this last night. All it said was there are 78 cases traced back to Disneyland and everyone should go get vaxed!! 78 cases. Are any severe? Is anyone even in the hospital? Probably not. My fave part was they of course showed that stock CDC photo of a kid with severe measles (you know the one, we’ve all seen it), just to scare some people into vaxxing. Never mind how many of these cases are in vaxed people Of course the media takes opportunities like this to blow up any new topic. Just like Ebola was the main topic for a couple months and now it’s dead. But I keep seeing these horrifically judgmental headlines about the measles being started by a non-vaxxed person. Is there actually proof to this claim? Or is this the media’s way of another vax scare tactic? It has me doing new research of my part since my son is not vaxxed but I think I’m still at the conclusion that the MMR vax scares me more than measles do. Maybe I’m completely naive, maybe it’s not close enough to home but I honestly feel like the media Is once again dramatizing the situation and using it to bully and scare the non-vaxers.  How can there ever be a truly reasonable, peaceful discussion on the topic when the vast majority of news outlets blatantly push a particular agenda? There is virtually no balanced reporting. Dissenting views are ridiculed as quackery. I really think society doesn’t want to know the truth, they cant handle the truth,fear is what drives the normalcy of their lives. Like the above comment says, people would be in panic and have no sense of control over their lives if they found out that their children were truly harmed by a vaccine that their trusted Dr. and Government reassured them that was safe and then have their 2 month old child die of S.I.D.S. shortly after. It’s safer to not know the truth, but when one seeks the truth,it will be found….. I’m a selective vaxer and I revealed that in pro-vaxers FB thread yesterday that I know personally, the lack of information and immaturity that ensued was crazy. I was told non-vaxers follow junk science and base their decisions from Jenny McCarthy and Kristin Cavalleri. I posted vaccine incidence rate from AAP for MMR and the vaccine injury website from the government. No response to that just blatant dismissal and disregard with reference to public health. And honestly, I’m too chicken to not vaccinate my daughter but I’m selective and prioritized a schedule that worked for us.</spannedText>
