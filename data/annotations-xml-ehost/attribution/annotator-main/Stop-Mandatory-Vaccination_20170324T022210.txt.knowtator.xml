Years and years of struggle and therapy and Dr’s. My 23 yr old daughter had an IQ of 3-5 yr old and can never be alone. My heart goes out to all victim and their families of vaccine injuries.. It’s just not worth it.. Give us chicken pox, measles etc.. I had it all as a kid and I survived and so did the majority or people.. The explosion of autism and special needs kids has exploded with the increase of vaccines.. I pray people wake up and stop following the propaganda and do your own research.</spannedText>

        <spannedText>In 1992 my 15 month old daughter had MMR and HIB and one other shot. Developed measles from the shot, strange looking stools, then within 2 weeks had swelling joints out of the blue sky. After taking her to 10 different doctors who said 10 different things (one doctor suggested her toes were swelled because of some powder I must have used on her feet-even though only 5 out of 10 toes were swelled)-we took her to Boston Childrens’ and had a diagnoses of Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. The head of rheumatology agreed with me when I said it had to be from the MMR vaccine. The whole waiting room was full of kids the same age with swollen joints after MMR vaccine.</spannedText>

        <spannedText>I got an H1N1 vaccine when 16 weeks pregnant w/ fraternal twins in 2009. Within days, I had edema. 1 week after vaccination, I went into labor &amp; both membranes ruptured (pPROM). 2 weeks after vaccination, the first twin was born. 6 weeks after vaccination, the second twin was born. Neither of my twins were born mature enough to survive outside my womb. In Nov ’12, when my youngest son was 22 months old, 2 children were vaccinated w/ the flu mist on their way to our Friday morning playdate. After playing for a couple of hours, their mother mentioned it to the rest of the mothers at the playdate. That evening, my son developed a fever. He sat at about 102 temp for 3 days. Slowly, over time on Monday his condition degraded &amp; I drew him a dose of fever reducer, with the intention to give it to him about half an hour before bedtime. 15 minutes before bedtime, his fever spiked suddenly &amp; he had a febrile seizure. The seizure broke his spiking fever &amp; it went back down to 102 or below. Over the next few days, he recovered. His illness was attributed to the playmates shedding live flu virus from the flu mist vaccine.</spannedText>

        <spannedText>My almost 15 yr old son is vaccine-injured with autism. He was advanced with everything, especially his verbal skills. Once he received his vaccines at 15 mths of MMR, DTaP, Polio, etc, he started having febrile seizures. With every seizure, he went backwards 2 mths. He lost all words, except 3, all potty training, etc. It broke my heart!! He is now diagnosed with epilepsy along with his high functioning autism/asperger’s. Granted through years of speech therapy 3 times a week and my mom and I doing it at home 3 times a day, he’s now verbal. There’s still times when he gets overexcited and you can’t understand him. The last shot he had was against my will and a doctor’s orders by his dad. That was the beginning of hell for him and my family again! He became extremely violent and defiant to the point of assaulting me and anyone else that was near by him. It got so bad with the bruises at school that I attempted to admit him for inpatient treatment. Please I beg you don’t vaccinate your child! I now have a 2 yr old son, vax-free, that is very healthy!</spannedText>

        <spannedText>Nine month old went into respiratory distress and was rushed to ER 5 hours after receiving a flu shot. She was up to date until that point. Was sick for 10 days after. No long term affects as far as I can tell. She is 9 years old now, gate program, 2 grades ahead in reading and writing and on par for every other academic category. I attribute that to a) breastfeeding exclusively for the first year and b) stopping vaccines completely. She is also rarely sick. Gets a mild cold about once a year. No chronic illness, no rashes, eczema, psoriasis, stomach issues, etc. No vaccines since 9 months. I should add, I went on to become a nurse after taking the no-vax stance and continue to stand by it even after my medical education (and because of it).</spannedText>

        <spannedText>Wow, where to start… I could agree with most of the parents here. Just happy our eyes opened up and we stopped before our eldest was severely injured. He was ahead on all of his milestones and development, he sat up strongly unattended just before 4 months, but the 4 months shots is where things went really bad very fast, probably just built up from the ones before those. He started regressing with each shot up until 9 months. Eczema, his one eye started pulling inwards slightly, he barely slept (especially at night) up until just past 2 years of age, screaming and severely losing control over his emotions almost 24/7 (especially at night), “night terrors” for 3 months straight, speech delay, at the age of 3 years and 3 months, he still struggles to drink from a cup/glass (it’s like those muscle reflexes just aren’t developed and wont), he still loses control over his emotions which leads to hours and hours of heartbreaking crying sessions, he started walking a bit late, he was constantly so so so very sick, had terrible reflux and colic, a few days after his 4 months shots, he got sick and sicker and sicker and ended up in the hospital almost completely unable to breathe, doctors, nurses and physio therapist all said that they were amazed at how he was still able to breathe at all, he is an extremely fussy eater, still have skin issues related to the chicken pox vaccine (looks like it might be shingles that keeps flaring up), we have also suspected juvenile arthritis, still keeping an eye on it. These are only the ones i can think of now. Even i have severe allergies since i can remember and struggle with IBS at times and migraines. Wish we knew the truth earlier or could find an undo button and give our son the best chance in health that he deserves. It’s the most heartsore burden to live with. When he can talk better and understand better, i want to apologise to him AGAIN for the millionth time. He needs to know we are sorry, WE also need this too. It could have been so much worse if we continued. Wish someone told us during my first pregnancy to DO THE RESEARCH AND NEVER STOP! We needed to be awakened sooner.</spannedText>

Eczema, his one eye started pulling inwards slightly, he barely slept (especially at night) up until just past 2 years of age, screaming and severely losing control over his emotions almost 24/7 (especially at night), “night terrors” for 3 months straight, speech delay, at the age of 3 years and 3 months, he still struggles to drink from a cup/glass (it’s like those muscle reflexes just aren’t developed and wont), he still loses control over his emotions which leads to hours and hours of heartbreaking crying sessions, he started walking a bit late, he was constantly so so so very sick, had terrible reflux and colic, a few days after his 4 months shots, he got sick and sicker and sicker and ended up in the hospital almost completely unable to breathe, doctors, nurses and physio therapist all said that they were amazed at how he was still able to breathe at all, he is an extremely fussy eater, still have skin issues related to the chicken pox vaccine (looks like it might be shingles that keeps flaring up), we have also suspected juvenile arthritis, still keeping an eye on it. These are only the ones i can think of now. Even i have severe allergies since i can remember and struggle with IBS at times and migraines. Wish we knew the truth earlier or could find an undo button and give our son the best chance in health that he deserves. It’s the most heartsore burden to live with. When he can talk better and understand better, i want to apologise to him AGAIN for the millionth time. He needs to know we are sorry, WE also need this too. It could have been so much worse if we continued. Wish someone told us during my first pregnancy to DO THE RESEARCH AND NEVER STOP! We needed to be awakened sooner.</mentionClass>

        <spannedText>Both of my girls were nothing but sick from vaccines. When we were listening to the doctor and doing every vaccine, they had eczema, allergies, asthma, bowel issues, ear infections. It was a rare week we weren’t in the doctors office. There were creams, antibiotics, steroids, inhalers, nebulizers, a couple trips to the ER, a hospitalization. They were nothing but sick all the time. Then my nephew got encephalitis FROM his vaccines, lost all his language, potty training, developed seizures, and when the symptoms that started THAT DAY never went away, they diagnosed with autism. That is what woke me up. I stopped taking my kids to the doctor, no more vaccines for either one, and began the long and grueling road to recovery. We went all organic in food, cleaning and personal care. We started chiropractic and to heal their guts. For now, they are healthier than they have ever been, although my youngest is showing signs of autoimmunity and we have to take her in for testing. I’m autoimmune myself, still trying to figure out which flavor of autoimmunity it is, but it is severe. Vaccines were nothing but poison for my family and caused catastrophic harm.</spannedText>

        <spannedText>My oldest son was vaccinated to one and a half on a delayed schedule and he stopped talking after he had his MMR. Now he suffers a speech delay and he had severe eczema that went away when we stopped vaccinating him. I was vaccine injured after having the Tdap vaccine after I had my son. A week after having the vaccine and giving birth I was rushed to the emergency room in pain all over my body. They couldn’t figure out what was going on and it took me over a year and a half until I was finally diagnosed with heavy metal toxicity, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. All autoimmune diseases!!! It was a naturopathic doctor and integrative medicine and a chiropractor that helped me heal my body. I’m still not 100%, but I’m a whole lot better than I was. I had zero symptoms before I had the vaccine and I never got sick in my life only about every 5 to 6 years and I would just get the 24 hour flu that was it. Now I’m having to start over and rebuild my whole immune system. I’m sick all the time and when I get sick it’s really bad. My sister in law also got the Tdap vaccine and within two days she was paralyzed from head to toe and couldn’t breathe on her own and was put on life support for 4 months. She was diagdiagnosed with GB syndrome and had to go through a whole year of physical therapy learning how to walk and move her arms again. Today she has to wear braces on her legs to walk, she has severe nerve damage and is in pain all the time. She’s only a couple years older than I am.</spannedText>

        <spannedText>Horrible reaction to hep b vaccine the day he was born. Born at 6:21 am, was doing amazing. Latching perfectly and looking at us when we talked to him. Hep b shot was given around 3 pm and he started crying about an hour later, loud painful cry that did not stop for over 10 hours. Would latch then pull away and cry. This I later found out was an encephalitis cry. I didn’t know and the nurses looked at each other with concern, but did nothing. I vaccinated on schedule. He did a similar cry at 2 months, but not as bad. Just over a year, I knew something was wrong. He didn’t seem to understand us. Diagnosed with PDD-NOS at 2, and later full autism at 4. I regret not knowing, and I’m disgusted with those that know but don’t care. And they do know. Stopped vaccines at 17 months, but he’d had 29 by then.</spannedText>

        <spannedText>My daughter started having seizures, extreme lethargy after her very first round of vaccines at 4 months within in hours. She was a happy healthy baby before- we did an alternative schedule and did two at a time – my doctor told me her reaction was perfectly normal so we continued every 6 weeks and each time her seizures got worse – we finally stopped at 10 months – she had so many seizures when they finally stopped she was so lethargic she didn’t open her eyes for almost 3 days – she had delayed speech and signed until she was almost 2 – she is now very healthy and seizure free 3 year old. My son is 1 and has same reaction at 8 weeks – we decided to do one shot at a time. My kids are both MTHFR positive – I find most interesting is my daughter has chronic eczema and when she does pick up a bug she is prone to high fevers – my son on the other has had a cold once and that’s it.</spannedText>

        <spannedText>Right after my now six year olds shots at 2 yrs, she began having hours long night terrors every night. This lasted two years. She also began showing signs of sensory processing disorder (which is on the autism spectrum), but we didn’t realize that’s what it was until she was 4. She regressed in speech, although the doctor said it was normal, and just encouraged us to put her in speech class when she got into preschool. She also had loss of hearing for about a year – not total loss, but she just stopped being able to hear everything and was constantly saying “what’d you say? I can’t hear you!” Ear nose and throat doctor said her hearing was fine and she just had “selective hearing.” Her hearing returned to normal around age 4, interestingly enough around the time she finally stopped having night terrors every night. She has asthma, that began around age 2, chronic bronchiolitis – she gets this at least three or four times each cold season, and it turns into pneumonia almost every time. She has skin allergies and food aversions, and is six years old and weighs 35lb, can wear size 2T clothes with no problem. Now that I know what I know, I completely and entirely see the link between her two year shots and ALL of these problems. She was a healthy baby, so chubby and so happy. She has melt downs at least a dozen or more times a day when textures, routines, foods, lights, sounds, etc aren’t the way she expects them to be.</spannedText>

        <mentionClass id="AttrContent">Right after my now six year olds shots at 2 yrs, she began having hours long night terrors every night. This lasted two years. She also began showing signs of sensory processing disorder (which is on the autism spectrum), but we didn’t realize that’s what it was until she was 4. She regressed in speech, although the doctor said it was normal, and just encouraged us to put her in speech class when she got into preschool. She also had loss of hearing for about a year – not total loss, but she just stopped being able to hear everything and was constantly saying “what’d you say? I can’t hear you!” Ear nose and throat doctor said her hearing was fine and she just had “selective hearing.” Her hearing returned to normal around age 4, interestingly enough around the time she finally stopped having night terrors every night. She has asthma, that began around age 2, chronic bronchiolitis – she gets this at least three or four times each cold season, and it turns into pneumonia almost every time.

        <spannedText>My son’s eczema started after his first round of shots at 2 months old. We continued to vaccinate and he continued to get worse. At 3 years old I figured out that the shots were triggering his already hyper active immune system. We did find out in the following years he is allergic to foods including soy (Prevnar 13 contains soy protein) and peanuts (not sure which shots speficially contain peanut oil). We also found out that he has the MTHFR gene mutation which means his body can not detox the way other people can. We then spent two years getting him off of the topical steroids his body had become addicted to.</spannedText>

        <spannedText>My oldest got sick following each set of shots. I was told it was many things “oh he probably just got a virus” “it’s just a coincidence” ” it’s bronchitis” “it’s bronchialitis” ” it might be adthma” “it’s just croup” so so many excuses. He also had constant ear infections and caught many virus’. Was sick all the time. Right before his 1st birthday he got the mmr and chicken pox vaccine. He had a reaction on his thigh a big ,raised, hard, bright red, perfect rectangle around the injection site. It was there for weeks again I was told its normal. He again was sick with high fevers and a cough but soon he started having night terrors very violent ones where we had to restrain him for his safety and ours, he stopped answering when we’d call his name we had to have his hearing checked several times because everyone thought he was going deaf, he could no longer communicate what he wanted which resulted in banging his head in frustration, couldn’t take him in public without meltdowns, suddenly the train going by and vacuuming would make him freak out….so many changes. He has aspergers I know it’s from his shots. My second son we spaced out his vaccines and started down the same path constant ear infections resulting in tubes twice, constant fevers, illnesses, asthma and he also has bahavior issues we are sorting out right now. Since stopping vaccines neither of them have asthma anymore nor have they had another ear infection. I have 2 unvaxed children also neither have asthma and only 1 has had an ear infection and only once.</spannedText>
