        <spannedText>It’s not about the danger of measles or any vaccine Empowering the state to inject you or your children against your will is a bigger threat than measles or any vaccine. Videos: The Dangers of Vaccines Infowars.com | February 3, 2015 The establishment media is desperately pushing the myth that vaccines are completely safe and effective and have even suggested the government should force you to take them . Recently, the flu vaccine claimed another child and the Disneyland measles outbreak is being blamed on the unvaccinated, but the system cannot explain why fully vaccinated people are spreading the flu after coming down with it. The vaccine hoax is starting to fail. But now the medical-industrial complex is pushing the flu scare to new heights. Unfortunately parents, the elderly and the ignorant will roll up their sleeves to inject this toxic cocktail into their bodies and force their children to do the same. The public has been conditioned into taking the vaccines without question thanks to fear mongering by the mainstream media who claim the MMR shot will protect you from the measles, but what they’re not telling you is that people who have received the CDC recommended doses of the vaccine are still catching and passing on measles to others. And the cat calls of “safe and effective” spewed out by the minions of Big Pharma are also a farce.</spannedText>
