        <spannedText>Many thanks for all your work. I had mumps on my first day of school….no ill effects. Then in rapid succession I got rubella (hardly noticed but I got lifelong immunity confirmed by a blood test when I was 19), then measles and scarlet fever….I’m still here. Don’t know why I didn’t get chicken pox til I was 17 (the worst of the so-called childhood diseases at that age…..wish I’d got it earlier as I missed mock A levels….my husband got chicken pox at age 24…he was so ill) My eldest daughter had mumps and rubella and I did let her have the single measles vaccination at 18 months.. Why did my GP push for her to have the MMR at ages 15? (I refused) I asked him. No answer. I asked how many children had blood tests to see if they had in fact got antibodies from the vaccination (not necessarily protection from catching the disease as you know) He looked at me in surprise. I asked him ‘What if a girl has the rubella vaccine but happens to be under the weather and the vaccine doesn’t take….and then she thinks she’s protected and doesn’t avoid rubella when she’s pregnant?’…again he looked at me in surprise. I asked him why he trusted that the vaccines always worked and that there were no side effects. I don’t go to him any more. It’s very, very difficult for conventionally trained medical folks to step outside the box. My husband taught classical guitar to a charming, gentle psychologist who teaches medical students. She sees many of them them turn from eager, keen, bright youngsters into ‘clones’ who daren’t rock the boat in case they get disciplined by the old boys. She herself encountered arrogance from some medics when her rmother was ill. She returned to her students and begged them not to become arrogant when they qualify. Several sneered and said they were entitled to! Sigh! I’m a nurse and I’ve worked with wonderful, wonderful medics whom I would trust with my life so I’m not a ‘doctor basher’ but things have to come out in the open. If they didn’t we’d still be bleeding and purging! Look up how George Washington died….thanks in part to the ‘best medics of the day’. They weren’t malevolent, they just believed they were doing their best. What’s that quote about truth going through three stages? First it’s ridiculed, then it’s vehemently fought against and then it’s accepted as self-evident. Something like that. I just can’t believe that injecting noxious stuff directly into the body, bypassing the normal protective measurs of the mucous membranes etc is beneficial, especially into tiny babies (even newborns!) when their immune system is not fully functional. How can it be right to give them a cocktail of umpteen vaccines (where would they get Hep B anyway? And where’s the vaccine for Hep C….far more contagious) Surely good nutrition, clean water, decent housing etc is far more beneficial to produce a sound immune system. How on earth did the human race survive for eons without vaccination? How come we didn’t all die out? Animals too….they’re being affected by their multiple vaccinations….how did animals survive? Somehow all this vaccination hype just doesn’t add up. And how can one type of flu vaccination ‘protect’ against a rapidly mutating virus? And have there been double’blind trials to test it? Sorry to go on…you get the picture. I’m sorry that some commenters have to get so cross. I am a Quaker and in our advices and queries (not a creed or dogma) one stands out ‘Consider it possible that you may be wrong’ Once upon a time they said that the USA would fold without the slave trade….a few wise good souls didn’t go along with that. The slave trade was abolished….what happened? Well the USA went on to become the world’s biggest economy. I know it’s not healthy now but you see what I mean. [ED: Jimmy, did you ever get a reply to your open letter? Did you ever send it to the person concerned? How come you just ignored the evidence on CHS and went off making false and wild claims? The following goes to show James D Cole [aka jdc325 and 325jdc] is mathematically challenged, ignorant or a untruthful or possibly all three. He can say which he wants to be known as. So James, your data must also be “misleading, out-of-date, and inaccurate”. The reason he gave to justify this claim was “Acute measles infection has claimed lives in years when” the graph “predicted no deaths would occur”. And with only 2 deaths from acute measles [according to the HPA] since 1992, that works out at a chance of 0.1 deaths per annum over the entire population of England and Wales – which is roughly 55 million – give or take for annual fluctuations etc. So not only is the trendline on both graphs presenting a reliable picture showing mortality falling below 1 in 55 million per annum, but actual mortality is in line with the trend shown by both graphs. And as this is a logarithmic graph, it does not predict no deaths as Cole claims – so again either he is untruthful or ignorant or mathematically challenged or all of these. Do let us know James. So not a “daft graph” at all but one showing much the same trend as the HPA data shows. So also not “misleading”. Whereas it is moronic to contradict that statement – with a chance of 0.1 deaths per annum over the entire population of England and Wales, we and most normal people would be inclined to think that 0.1 per annum per 55 million population is sufficiently below 1 in 55 million to be reliably within the trend. But of course for mathematically challenged people over at Ben Goldacre’s Badscience.net forum 0.1 is a way larger number than 1. So Cole then moves on from abuse arising from his own ignorance, mathematical incompetence or dishonesty to complain that as “measles-containing vaccine coverage” … “has been at or above 80% since the introduction of MMR in 1988″ …. “How on earth can you (or anyone else) possibly justify using the figures for measles mortality in a country with 80%+ levels of vaccination to suggest that the chances of death if no one were vaccinated would be less than 1 in 55 million?” And particularly, the fact that a exponential trendline results in a straightline is an immensely strong indication that measles mortality would continue to fall exponentially. If the introduction of the vaccines had any effect that effect would be to accelerate the fall. So James, you see, it can be done. And to make the point more firmly, here is the ONS data plotted up to 1967 – before the introduction of the measles vaccine – and with the trendline plotted forward to where the chance of mortality falls below 1 in 55 million: But you just will not ever accept you are wrong. We saw that with your attack on Sue Reid’s journalism where you were forced to admit you attacked her professionalism solely because you disagreed with her reporting in a national newspaper the Italian Health Ministry not contesting the evidence before the Italian Court showing that the MMR vaccine did cause Valentino Bocca’s autism. And here we see the same thing. Despite 110 years of data and clear mathematically presented graphical evidence, James D Cole [aka jdc325 and 325jdc] just cannot accept it because it goes against the position he has taken and he can never admit he is wrong. He cannot admit that “in the event of a zero rate of vaccination” the annual rate of measles mortality will still continue to decrease. James D Cole also cannot accept the clear conclusion of the peer reviewed medical paper cited in the article above: Englehandt SF, Halsey NA, Eddins DL, Hinman AR. Measles mortality in the United States 1971-1975. Am J Public Health 1980;70:1166–1169 which also confirms that “Measles mortality rates were inversely related to median family income” which means in baby language that as people become better off year on year, measles mortality will keep on falling. In the teeth of the evidence from 110 years James D Cole firmly believes or is being dishonest in stating that “All it would take to kill hundreds in the next decade would be for vaccination coverage to drop sufficiently. It wouldn’t even have to drop to zero – somewhere between 55-75% ought to do it.” But UK measles vaccine coverage was well below 55% in the 1970’s and early 1980s. The average UK mortality between 1968 when the single measles vaccine was introduced and 1987 was 20 and not hundreds and was falling over that entire period at the same rate exponentially as it had been before 1968. And James you clearly are being dishonest in claiming a graph is “misleading, out-of-date, and inaccurate” when 1) it states clearly on its face the periods it covered – 1900-1999 2) the two deaths you talk about were in 2006 and 2008 3) there had been no deaths from acute measles since 1992 3) the HPA data shows the much the same trend as that graph and 4) the trendline was used to illustrate the position by 2007 of mortality falling below 1 in 55 million by then – which it most certainly had done – based on the trend of 100 years data to 1999. Still no answer (I kind of start liking our little, internal jokes). I didn’t make any statements there, barring one about no evidence for linkage. Otherwise than that – you are the one who challenges the consensus, burden of the proof lies with you. Moreover, something I haven’t noticed before – if you make a regression on years 1955-65 your curve will have a slope that is not significantly different from zero. 10 years of no improvement and suddenly off we go. Here you have it – evidence (as in “not proof”) that it would not at all be hilarious that sanitation improvement stopped being the decisive factor and vaccination took over. Now let me answer my own questions since you’re not bold enough to confront them: Your website is fighting some claims that “ring vaccination” didn’t save the day and I’m inclined to agree (who cares now if it was “ring” or not?) as long as you agree with the article you’re quoting [Kaplan et al.] which provides a very nice correlation between vaccination and incidence of smallpox. 10) “Do you agree that serious adverse reactions to vaccines are substantially under reported?” (your question) No, is it a consensus I’ve missed? But bring it on, I want to see evidence. And funny that measles incidence is overreported, but serious consequences of the vaccine are underreported. Funny that CDR is constantly reporting that most (if not all) confirmed cases of measles are in unvaccinated people (but you’re not against efficacy of vaccines, are you?) It is interesting to note from the graphs you have put up (Figure 1: Reported measles cases and death per 100,000 population, United States, 1912-1975) that while measles mortality dropped before vaccination, due to improved sanitation and better nutrition, the incidence remained the same at 200-400 cases per 100,000 population until the 1960’s, since when, incidence has dropped markedly to a minimum, with a later peak which still didn’t go above 40 per 100,000 population! The beginning of the decline coincides with the introduction of Measles vaccination in the early 1960’s. You seem to be having problems interpreting graphs and available information. See, it is a known bias in scientific research that when we look for information with a particular objective in mind, we are generally biased to find more on what we seek, and neglect available information on what we don’t want to see. Vaccines are not the best means of prevention for all diseases. Scarlet fever and typhoid are diseases that are treatable by antibiotics and preventable by good hygiene. Although vaccine is available for typhoid, the efficacy is lower, and public health officials do not promote universally vaccinating all children against typhoid! Influenza another disease that may not benefit everyone from vaccination. Note that in most countries, it is available commercially (for sale) and not subsidized by governments. The disease is not severe, except in extremes of age, and the virus continuously mutates, so the vaccine strain may only be effective for a short epidemic of the particular vaccine strain (generally for about 1 year or a season). It may benefit elderly, who carry higher risk of death from influenza. Vaccines that have been used extensively in humans over long periods of time with proven reduction of death and disease burden include vaccines included in childhood vaccination programmes (EPI programmes) in most countries. These vaccines are given to reduce diseases with high burdens of death and/or disability (eg. polio, measles), where effective curative treatment (eg. antivirals) is not available or limited in efficacy (eg. Hepatitis B). These are fully funded (available free) or subsidized by governments after considering (with technical advice form agencies like the WHO) whether these diseases are prevalent in their countries, or may cause huge losses if introduced into a non-immune community, and the benefits of the vaccines, vs. risks. :”Attentuation is a well-known phenomenon. Good luck with your opinions. Immunity can be afforded by asymptomatic infection – you know, where the “disease” circulates amongst those who suffer no symptoms” The death rates for these diseases for the unvaccinated but otherwise healthy in developed world in the last couple of decades world are well known. Your focus on smallpox, an extinct disease is baffling.The death rates make a nonsense of your claims: Mortality rates from measles in America and the developed world in the unvaccinated are 1/5000, not 1 in 25 million. Mortality rates from rubella are about 1/300 in the US, and about 1/900 with one of the worlds best healthcare system (Netherlands outbreak in unvaccinated children in religious groups). Diptheria mortality is 1/5 for young children, about 1/10 for adults. The vaccinated don’t get these diseases. If you flipped the UK magically to being unvacinated for all things, a couple of million people at least would die. Compared to perhaps a hundred or so dead or brain damaged from vaccines. And no, they aren’t 100% safe, no medicine is. I’ve noticed you’ve avoided posting modern mortality rates here. Also, no direct comparisones of before vaccination to after vaccinated death rates. You don’t show the change in different death rates, you just show the improvement in survival rates due to the improvement of living standards and health care over the 20th century. Well, chickenpox has a mortality rate too. About 90 people die in the US, mainly adults with complications, but also healthy children The death rate is about 1/100,000,000 for healthy children, but 1/300,000 for adults. I’m in the UK, where we don’t vaccinate. Introduction of the chickenpox vaccine in the US saves about 70-80 lives a year. I’d also to like point out Encephalopathy is caused by viral infections. These are a known but rare kind of vaccination injury. Not caused by thimerasol by by the virus vaccine. A non vaccinated person is at higher risk of encepahalitis when they catch ‘wild’ variants of rubella /measles etc. Herpes (cold sore) encephalitis is a known cause of ASD type brain injury. This kind of brain damage from encephalopaty is really rare. And the overwhelming results from scientific studies into autism find that there has been no real increase in the rates of autism over the past few decades, just increased diagnosis. I’ve dug through the studies, only one Californian study supports in increase, about a dozen others support no change/better diagnosis. “Some children who would nowadays be diagnosed unambiguously with autistic disorder had been diagnosed with developmental language disorder in the past. This finding has implications for our understanding of the epidemiology of autism.” “The rate of pervasive developmental disorders is higher than reported 15 years ago. The rate in this study is comparable to that in previous birth cohorts from the same area and surveyed with the same methods, suggesting a stable incidence” There is evidence that the broadening of the concept, the expansion of diagnostic criteria, the development of services, and improved awareness of the condition have played a major role in explaining this increase, although it cannot be ruled out that other factors might have also contributed to that trend. …. Although it is clear that prevalence estimates have gone up over time, this increase most likely represents changes in the concepts, definitions, service availability, and awareness of autistic-spectrum disorders in both the lay and professional public. “The true incidence of autism spectrum disorders is likely to be within the range of 30-60 cases per 10 000, a huge increase over the original estimate 40 years ago of 4 per 10000. The increase is largely a consequence of improved ascertainment and a considerable broadening of the diagnostic concept. However, a true risk due to some, as yet to be identified, environmental risk factor cannot be ruled out. There is no support for the hypothesis for a role of either MMR or thimerosal in causation, but the evidence on the latter is more limited” “The recorded prevalence of autism has increased considerably in recent years. This reflects greater recognition, with changes in diagnostic practice associated with more trained diagnosticians; broadening of diagnostic criteria to include a spectrum of disorder; a greater willingness by parents and educationalists to accept the label (in part because of entitlement to services); and better recording systems, among other factors. The cause(s) of autism remains unclear. There is a strong genetic component which, along with prenatally determined neuro-anatomical/biochemical changes, makes any post-natal ’cause’ unlikely.” “To our knowledge, there is no published information on the epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in adults. If the prevalence of autism is increasing, rates in older Conclusions Conducting epidemiologic research on ASD in adults is feasible. The prevalence of ASD in this population is similar to that found in children. The lack of an association with age is consistent with there having been no increase in prevalence and with its causes being temporally constant.” ABSTRACT—According to some lay groups, the nation is experiencing an autism epidemic—a rapid escalation in the prevalence of autism for unknown reasons. However, no sound scientific evidence indicates that the increasing number of diagnosed cases of autism arises from anything other than purposely broadened diagnostic criteria, coupled with deliberately greater public awareness and intentionally improved case finding. Why is the public perception so disconnected from the scientific evidence? In this article we review three primary sources of misunderstanding: lack of awareness about the changing diagnostic criteria, uncritical acceptance of a conclusion illogically drawn in a California-based study, and inattention to a crucial feature of the ‘‘child count’’ data reported annually by the U.S. Department of Education. the study, by researchers from the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy at Columbia University, found that children living near a child who has been previously diagnosed with autism have a much higher chance of being diagnosed themselves in the following year. The increased likelihood of being diagnosed is not due to environmental factors or contagious agents, the study found. Rather, it is due mainly to parents learning about autism from other parents who have a child diagnosed with the disorder. We could not assess changes in actual disease incidence with these data, but federal and state administrative changes in policy and law favoring better identification and reporting of autism are likely contributing factors to the prevalence increases and may imply that autism spectrum disorder has been underdiagnosed in the past. Even though the prevalence rates refer to slightly different age cohorts, it was concluded that the apparent increase is in part due to better detection, but also to new cases born to immigrant parents. Typical cases of autistic disorder accounted for 75% of cases, and 20% had normal or near-normal IQs. Reevaluating the incidence of pervasive developmental disorders: impact of elevated rates of detection through implementation of an integrated system of screening in Toyota, Japan. An approximately 11-fold increase was noted in prevalence of PDD compared to a previous survey two decades ago, and two main factors were believed to account for this apparent sharp increase. First, inclusion of high-functioning subjects detected during infancy, and second, higher rates of diagnosis resulting from an integrated process of screening. I’m in my forties, I’ve known five autistic boys, one is a relative. Back in the eighties and seventies, only one would have been diagnosed with autism, the others all have fairly mild Aspergers. Even the obviously autistic one would probably be have been labelled as retarded not autistic.I’ve asked older teachers and doctors if there’s a higher incidence now. The answer has been a mix of ‘better diagnosis and awareness’ from the GP and ‘we just used to call them naughty’ from older teachers. Well I am pleased to see intelligent people having a reasonable discussion, a little sad about the name calling and anger demonstrated by both sides of the debate. I am a research scientist working in the field of sepsis, after having my first child I became very interested in vaccines for obvious reasons. To the author of this blog, first of all great job in putting this information together, the pro vaccine agenda clearly has more money, influence, and the advantage in promoting the pro vaccine view when compared to the anti-vaccine group. That being said as a scientist who knows a little bit about basic immunology, would you deny the basic immunological principles of T-cell and B-cell memory cells? Sorry if I bore people but very basic simplified immunology describes that upon an initial infection cells such as neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells migrate to the site of infection this process is termed the innate immune response, as the infection persists macrophages, B-cells and dendritic cells phagocytose antigen/bacteria and present them to T-cells this later process is termed the adaptive immune response, in addition B-cells begin to undergo isotype switching and will produce antibodies. After the infection has been cleared there will be antibodies left to that foreign pathogen and memory T-cells to that pathogen. These memory cells remain and if that same pathogen is encountered again these memory cells are capable of removing the pathogen much faster than the initial infection, this process is called immunological memory. Taken together vaccines are nothing more than a replication of these basic immunology principles. A live virus, partial virus (cell wall, specific proteins) or a whole inactive virus at low doses are used to generate an immune response to create immunological memory. If this process occurs naturally in nature, why is their so much fear about the practical application of vaccines that replicate this natural process? Vaccines are based on sound scientific principles. I was born in 1980 so I took the entire cascade of vaccines and more when I started working due to patient contact. How can 46 does of 14 vaccines by the age of 6 be normal? What are the long term effects of priming a child’s immune system that many times. In addition to autism look at the all the auto immune disorders that have been popping up, psoriasis for example, look at the increased amount of allergic response that occur in the West due to hyper-active immune systems. I am also concerned about thimerosal, they tell pregnant women to watch their fish consumption for mercury but it is ok for infants to get this many doses. I am also concerned about squalene and others agents found in vaccines that cause infertility. Most importantly I am concerned about the marriage of big pharma with our health and doctors, allopathic medicine more often than not tends to want to cure everything with pharmaceuticals and than cure the side effects with more pharmaceuticals and none the while never looking at natural alternative remedies.</spannedText>

        <mentionClass id="AttrContent">Many thanks for all your work. I had mumps on my first day of school….no ill effects. Then in rapid succession I got rubella (hardly noticed but I got lifelong immunity confirmed by a blood test when I was 19), then measles and scarlet fever….I’m still here. Don’t know why I didn’t get chicken pox til I was 17 (the worst of the so-called childhood diseases at that age…..wish I’d got it earlier as I missed mock A levels….my husband got chicken pox at age 24…he was so ill) My eldest daughter had mumps and rubella and I did let her have the single measles vaccination at 18 months.. Why did my GP push for her to have the MMR at ages 15? (I refused) I asked him. No answer. I asked how many children had blood tests to see if they had in fact got antibodies from the vaccination (not necessarily protection from catching the disease as you know) He looked at me in surprise. I asked him ‘What if a girl has the rubella vaccine but happens to be under the weather and the vaccine doesn’t take….and then she thinks she’s protected and doesn’t avoid rubella when she’s pregnant?’…again he looked at me in surprise. I asked him why he trusted that the vaccines always worked and that there were no side effects. I don’t go to him any more. It’s very, very difficult for conventionally trained medical folks to step outside the box. My husband taught classical guitar to a charming, gentle psychologist who teaches medical students. She sees many of them them turn from eager, keen, bright youngsters into ‘clones’ who daren’t rock the boat in case they get disciplined by the old boys. She herself encountered arrogance from some medics when her rmother was ill. She returned to her students and begged them not to become arrogant when they qualify. Several sneered and said they were entitled to! Sigh! I’m a nurse and I’ve worked with wonderful, wonderful medics whom I would trust with my life so I’m not a ‘doctor basher’ but things have to come out in the open. If they didn’t we’d still be bleeding and purging! Look up how George Washington died….thanks in part to the ‘best medics of the day’. They weren’t malevolent, they just believed they were doing their best. What’s that quote about truth going through three stages? First it’s ridiculed, then it’s vehemently fought against and then it’s accepted as self-evident. Something like that. I just can’t believe that injecting noxious stuff directly into the body, bypassing the normal protective measurs of the mucous membranes etc is beneficial, especially into tiny babies (even newborns!) when their immune system is not fully functional. How can it be right to give them a cocktail of umpteen vaccines (where would they get Hep B anyway? And where’s the vaccine for Hep C….far more contagious) Surely good nutrition, clean water, decent housing etc is far more beneficial to produce a sound immune system. How on earth did the human race survive for eons without vaccination? How come we didn’t all die out? Animals too….they’re being affected by their multiple vaccinations….how did animals survive? Somehow all this vaccination hype just doesn’t add up. And how can one type of flu vaccination ‘protect’ against a rapidly mutating virus? And have there been double’blind trials to test it? Sorry to go on…you get the picture. I’m sorry that some commenters have to get so cross. I am a Quaker and in our advices and queries (not a creed or dogma) one stands out ‘Consider it possible that you may be wrong’ Once upon a time they said that the USA would fold without the slave trade….a few wise good souls didn’t go along with that. The slave trade was abolished….what happened? Well the USA went on to become the world’s biggest economy. I know it’s not healthy now but you see what I mean. [ED: Jimmy, did you ever get a reply to your open letter? Did you ever send it to the person concerned? How come you just ignored the evidence on CHS and went off making false and wild claims? The following goes to show James D Cole [aka jdc325 and 325jdc] is mathematically challenged, ignorant or a untruthful or possibly all three. He can say which he wants to be known as. So James, your data must also be “misleading, out-of-date, and inaccurate”. The reason he gave to justify this claim was “Acute measles infection has claimed lives in years when” the graph “predicted no deaths would occur”. And with only 2 deaths from acute measles [according to the HPA] since 1992, that works out at a chance of 0.1 deaths per annum over the entire population of England and Wales – which is roughly 55 million – give or take for annual fluctuations etc. So not only is the trendline on both graphs presenting a reliable picture showing mortality falling below 1 in 55 million per annum, but actual mortality is in line with the trend shown by both graphs. And as this is a logarithmic graph, it does not predict no deaths as Cole claims – so again either he is untruthful or ignorant or mathematically challenged or all of these. Do let us know James. So not a “daft graph” at all but one showing much the same trend as the HPA data shows. So also not “misleading”. Whereas it is moronic to contradict that statement – with a chance of 0.1 deaths per annum over the entire population of England and Wales, we and most normal people would be inclined to think that 0.1 per annum per 55 million population is sufficiently below 1 in 55 million to be reliably within the trend. But of course for mathematically challenged people over at Ben Goldacre’s Badscience.net forum 0.1 is a way larger number than 1. So Cole then moves on from abuse arising from his own ignorance, mathematical incompetence or dishonesty to complain that as “measles-containing vaccine coverage” … “has been at or above 80% since the introduction of MMR in 1988″ …. “How on earth can you (or anyone else) possibly justify using the figures for measles mortality in a country with 80%+ levels of vaccination to suggest that the chances of death if no one were vaccinated would be less than 1 in 55 million?” And particularly, the fact that a exponential trendline results in a straightline is an immensely strong indication that measles mortality would continue to fall exponentially. If the introduction of the vaccines had any effect that effect would be to accelerate the fall. So James, you see, it can be done. And to make the point more firmly, here is the ONS data plotted up to 1967 – before the introduction of the measles vaccine – and with the trendline plotted forward to where the chance of mortality falls below 1 in 55 million: But you just will not ever accept you are wrong. We saw that with your attack on Sue Reid’s journalism where you were forced to admit you attacked her professionalism solely because you disagreed with her reporting in a national newspaper the Italian Health Ministry not contesting the evidence before the Italian Court showing that the MMR vaccine did cause Valentino Bocca’s autism. And here we see the same thing. Despite 110 years of data and clear mathematically presented graphical evidence, James D Cole [aka jdc325 and 325jdc] just cannot accept it because it goes against the position he has taken and he can never admit he is wrong. He cannot admit that “in the event of a zero rate of vaccination” the annual rate of measles mortality will still continue to decrease. James D Cole also cannot accept the clear conclusion of the peer reviewed medical paper cited in the article above: Englehandt SF, Halsey NA, Eddins DL, Hinman AR. Measles mortality in the United States 1971-1975. Am J Public Health 1980;70:1166–1169 which also confirms that “Measles mortality rates were inversely related to median family income” which means in baby language that as people become better off year on year, measles mortality will keep on falling. In the teeth of the evidence from 110 years James D Cole firmly believes or is being dishonest in stating that “All it would take to kill hundreds in the next decade would be for vaccination coverage to drop sufficiently. It wouldn’t even have to drop to zero – somewhere between 55-75% ought to do it.” But UK measles vaccine coverage was well below 55% in the 1970’s and early 1980s. The average UK mortality between 1968 when the single measles vaccine was introduced and 1987 was 20 and not hundreds and was falling over that entire period at the same rate exponentially as it had been before 1968. And James you clearly are being dishonest in claiming a graph is “misleading, out-of-date, and inaccurate” when 1) it states clearly on its face the periods it covered – 1900-1999 2) the two deaths you talk about were in 2006 and 2008 3) there had been no deaths from acute measles since 1992 3) the HPA data shows the much the same trend as that graph and 4) the trendline was used to illustrate the position by 2007 of mortality falling below 1 in 55 million by then – which it most certainly had done – based on the trend of 100 years data to 1999. Still no answer (I kind of start liking our little, internal jokes). I didn’t make any statements there, barring one about no evidence for linkage. Otherwise than that – you are the one who challenges the consensus, burden of the proof lies with you. Moreover, something I haven’t noticed before – if you make a regression on years 1955-65 your curve will have a slope that is not significantly different from zero. 10 years of no improvement and suddenly off we go. Here you have it – evidence (as in “not proof”) that it would not at all be hilarious that sanitation improvement stopped being the decisive factor and vaccination took over. Now let me answer my own questions since you’re not bold enough to confront them: Your website is fighting some claims that “ring vaccination” didn’t save the day and I’m inclined to agree (who cares now if it was “ring” or not?) as long as you agree with the article you’re quoting [Kaplan et al.] which provides a very nice correlation between vaccination and incidence of smallpox. 10) “Do you agree that serious adverse reactions to vaccines are substantially under reported?” (your question) No, is it a consensus I’ve missed?

Well I am pleased to see intelligent people having a reasonable discussion, a little sad about the name calling and anger demonstrated by both sides of the debate. I am a research scientist working in the field of sepsis, after having my first child I became very interested in vaccines for obvious reasons. To the author of this blog, first of all great job in putting this information together, the pro vaccine agenda clearly has more money, influence, and the advantage in promoting the pro vaccine view when compared to the anti-vaccine group. That being said as a scientist who knows a little bit about basic immunology, would you deny the basic immunological principles of T-cell and B-cell memory cells? Sorry if I bore people but very basic simplified immunology describes that upon an initial infection cells such as neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells migrate to the site of infection this process is termed the innate immune response, as the infection persists macrophages, B-cells and dendritic cells phagocytose antigen/bacteria and present them to T-cells this later process is termed the adaptive immune response, in addition B-cells begin to undergo isotype switching and will produce antibodies. After the infection has been cleared there will be antibodies left to that foreign pathogen and memory T-cells to that pathogen. These memory cells remain and if that same pathogen is encountered again these memory cells are capable of removing the pathogen much faster than the initial infection, this process is called immunological memory. Taken together vaccines are nothing more than a replication of these basic immunology principles. A live virus, partial virus (cell wall, specific proteins) or a whole inactive virus at low doses are used to generate an immune response to create immunological memory. If this process occurs naturally in nature, why is their so much fear about the practical application of vaccines that replicate this natural process? Vaccines are based on sound scientific principles. I was born in 1980 so I took the entire cascade of vaccines and more when I started working due to patient contact. How can 46 does of 14 vaccines by the age of 6 be normal? What are the long term effects of priming a child’s immune system that many times. In addition to autism look at the all the auto immune disorders that have been popping up, psoriasis for example, look at the increased amount of allergic response that occur in the West due to hyper-active immune systems. I am also concerned about thimerosal, they tell pregnant women to watch their fish consumption for mercury but it is ok for infants to get this many doses. I am also concerned about squalene and others agents found in vaccines that cause infertility. Most importantly I am concerned about the marriage of big pharma with our health and doctors, allopathic medicine more often than not tends to want to cure everything with pharmaceuticals and than cure the side effects with more pharmaceuticals and none the while never looking at natural alternative remedies.</mentionClass>
