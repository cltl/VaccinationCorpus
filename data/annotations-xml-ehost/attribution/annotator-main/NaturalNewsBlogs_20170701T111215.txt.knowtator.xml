        <spannedText>I just got home from seeing VAXXED the Movie. I am outraged, disgusted and have this huge pit in the bottom of my stomach.  I’ve been writing and researching here on Natural News for over 2 years and have been a quiet participant in the decision not to vaccinate my children.  But this movie has you crying, shaking your head and then shaking your fist and leaves you with the conviction that we have to do something right now about this insanity.  I’m going to start close to home and try to get this DVD (when it is released in August) into the hand of every physician I know.  We are blessed to have many dear friends in the profession and my husband even leads a monthly retreat for a group of 40 doctors.  We need to get to the influencers and the ones who are in the trenches to understand how duped they have been.  We can make a difference and turn the tables on this. The director of the film posted this on the films website: For the last 20 years I have had to watch the suffering of those affected by autism as the problem multiplies year on year. What started with hope for a new understanding, new and effective treatments, and even prevention, turned to despair as special interests exploited their influence over the media to crush the science and the scientists. And then, two decades and a million damaged children later, one man, Dr. William Thompson – a CDC insider – decided to tell the truth and the embers of that early hope glow once more. Several years ago I decided that to take on the media you had to become the media. The best medium for this story is film. Our aim with this movie was to take this complex, high-level fraud and to give it context, and weave through it the tragic street-level narratives of ordinary families affected by autism. This film brings to the public a dark and uncomfortable truth. To ignore it would be most unwise. – Andrew Wakefield, March 2016 (Producer of Vaxxed the Movie) There is a scene where there is a pregnant doctor vaccinating one of her patients. When interviewed and asked if she would be vaccinating her baby, she said absolutely without hesitation.  Later in the film, after she reviewed the documents from written by the Whistleblower from the CDC and realized what had been done she was so shaken up and rightly so, knowing she was participating in a form of Russian roulette with her young patients.  She then said she would not ever give her children the MMR vaccine. I think it strikes such a raw nerve for anyone going to this movie in hearing the voices of the real parents and seeing the children affected with Autism so vividly on the big screen.  You get to see actual footage of their normal happy baby before the vaccine and then see them after. You are confronted with the devastating damage our governing bodies such as the CDC and other regulatory agencies are continuing to not only allow but now in many cases impose upon our next generation.  If nothing changes, by 2032 1 in 2 boys will have autism.  Let that sink in for a moment and imagine what this world looks like.  The latest statistic shows 1 in 65.  And it is important to note that boys are 5 times more likely to be autistic than girls. On March 27, 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new data on the prevalence of autism in the United States. This surveillance study identified 1 in 68 children (1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls) as having autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Take Action Now. Get to a showing of this film and bring as many people with you as you can.  If the movie isn’t being shown in your city, contact the organizers and see what can be done to get it there. Or commit to getting multiple copies of the DVD when it is released and passing it on to everyone. This movie is a game changer and even the most pro-vaccine people will not be able to deny the truth presented here. This is a must see and then we must take action.</spannedText>
