        <spannedText>The controversial film VAXXED, which has been censored at certain film festivals across the United States, recently opened at the Angelika Pop Up theater in Washington, D.C. The film is produced by Del Bigtree, a medical journalist and the past producer of the popular daytime show “The Doctors.” Mr. Bigtree states that when he learned about the top scientist whistleblower at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), that he knew this was the biggest story of his life, and that this was “bigger than Watergate.” Since the 2004 study that supposedly proved there was no link between the MMR vaccine and autism was published by the CDC, more than one million children have been diagnosed with autism, and now one of the study’s authors at the CDC has revealed that data was concealed that actually showed there was indeed a link between the vaccine and autism in some children. Mr. Bigtree makes it clear that this is not an anti-vaccine movie, but a movie about government corruption at the CDC. He was recently interviewed by Tammi Stefano of The National Safe Child Show in Los Angeles, and you can listen to the interview below. In April, Academy Award winning actor Robert De Niro, co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival, was pressured to remove the film from its scheduled debut at his New York film festival, but appeared on the Today Show and encouraged everyone to see the film. He was viciously attacked by the mainstream media for standing up for First Amendment rights in the film industry. (See: Robert De Niro Attacked for Asking Questions about Vaccines and Promoting Freedom of Speech.) De Niro announced this week that he was planning on his own documentary about vaccines, and was teaming up with filmmaker Harvey Weinstein. There will be Q&amp;As on Tuesday, May 24th and Wednesday, May 25th following the 5:45pm and 7:45pm shows at the Angelika Pop Up theater in Washington, D.C. with producers Del Bigtree and Polly Tommey and director Dr. Andrew Wakefield available to take questions. This is a perfect opportunity for members of Congress to view the film for themselves, since it has been mostly censored in mainstream media. Congressman Bill Posey has so far been the lone voice in Congress calling for hearings on the CDC whistleblower, scientist William Thompson. He holds thousands of pages of documents that allegedly clearly show fraud within the CDC regarding vaccine studies and autism. (See: Will CDC Whistleblower on Vaccines Testify Before Congress?) Call your representative in the U.S. Congress and ask them to view the film VAXXED and attend one of the Q&amp;A sessions. See Also: One of the biggest myths being propagated in the compliant mainstream media today is that doctors are either pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, and that the anti-vaccine doctors are all “quacks.” However, nothing could be further from the truth in the vaccine debate. Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding “the science” of vaccines, nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines. The two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all, and those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people, ALL the time, by force if necessary. Very few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions, and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field. In between these two extreme views, however, is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position. Many doctors who consider themselves “pro-vaccine,” for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual. Many doctors recommend a “delayed” vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule. Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine, recommending some, while determining that others are not worth the risk for children, such as the suspect seasonal flu shot. These doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions. In this eBook, I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position, which is probably not held by very many doctors at all, in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry, the federal government, and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.</spannedText>
